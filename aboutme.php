				<h3 class="text-center">I love making things,</h3>
				<p>It all started with Legos when I was a kid. I could spend hours assembling awesome cars, elevators, houses…</p>
				<p>Then my parents connected our family to the internet in 1996. I discovered QBasic and the satisfaction of writing lines of code to light letters up on the monitor. I cobbled together my first HTML webpage, complete with flashy GIFs and MIDI background music in 1998. PHP came about and I made my first dynamic website. Hardware was fascinating: I took computers apart and then learned how to build them from spare parts.</p>
				<p>Tinkering with an Arduino bridged the gap between software and our world: virtual lines of code could actuate things in the real world!</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">I love improving things,</h3>
				<!-- <p>It is very satisfying to trim down a cumbersome process and replace it by a few clicks and keystrokes. -->
				<p>I turned the hand written 200 pages thick stock ledger from the gas station I was working at into a single computer spreadsheet. This cut down errors drastically and made stock taking considerably easier.</p>
				<p>I did a similar thing when employed by an energy broker. Tracking commissions and invoicing suppliers became much easier, faster and more accurate.</p>
				<p>More recently, I created a bespoke VoIP telephone system from scratch for my partner and I to keep in touch with our families abroad. We now have overseas phone numbers ringing our Canadian phones, can place calls at very low rates and cut everyone‘s phone bills drastically.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">And all my skills are self-taught.</h3>
				<p>Everything I know about computers and programming is the result of experimentation, research and self-learning.</p>
				<p>I read magazines, books, documentations, follow online courses, ask a lot of questions on IRC and attend “geeky” gatherings. Then I build things and break them, learning by doing.</p>
				<p>I am currently studying Ruby and SASS. I had heard about Ruby‘s elegance and now that I am learning the language it mesmerises me.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">But it’s not all about computers.</h3>
					<p>For the last 10 years, I lived in 7 different countries, visited 24 countries on 5 continents and travelled around the world for 2 years.</p>
					<p>I was lucky enough to have more than a couple of days to spend in a location at a time and be more than a tourist. I got exposure to radically different cultures and made a point to blend in.</p>
					<p>This was by far the most amazing and enriching experience: it endowed me with an ability to adapt and consider things from a different perspective.</p>
